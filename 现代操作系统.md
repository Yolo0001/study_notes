## 第一章 引言

1. What are the two main functions of an operating system? 
   - 提供扩展机器
   - 管理I/O设备和其他系统资源
   - 让程序合理且高效的运行
   
2. In Section 1.4, nine different types of operating systems are described. Give a list of applications for each of these systems (one per operating systems type). 
   1. Mainframe operating system: Claims processing in an insurance company. 
   2. Server operating system: Speech-to-text conversion service for Siri. 
   3. Multiprocessor operating system: Video editing and rendering. 
   4. Personal computer operating system: Word processing application. 
   5. Handheld computer operating system: Context-aware recommendation system. 
   6. Embedded operating system: Programming a DVD recorder for recording TV. 
   7. Sensor-node operating system: Monitoring temperature in a wilderness area. 
   8. Real-time operating system: Air traffic control system. 
   9. Smart-card operating system: Electronic payment.
   
3. What is the difference between timesharing and multiprogramming systems? 
   1. multiprogramming 允许一个用户运行多道程序
   2. timesharing 允许多人使用自己的终端去访问计算系统并且计算
   3. 所有的timesharing 都是multiprogramming ，但multiprogramming 不都是timesharing ，因为multiprogramming 是一个人用一台电脑
   
4. To use cache memory, main memory is divided into cache lines, typically 32 or 64 bytes long. An entire cache line is cached at once. What is the advantage of caching an entire line instead of a single byte or word at a time? 
   - 内存访问遵循引用局部性规则，即读取一个位置，那么访问附近位置的概率会增大，缓存整个行，下一次缓存命中的概率会增大。将32或64字节的块传输到缓存行，这比将一个字节一个字节缓存的快。
   
5. On early computers, every byte of data read or written was handled by the CPU (i.e., there was no DMA). What implications does this have for multiprogramming? 
   1. multiprogramming主要让CPU有事可做，同时等待I/O完成。如果没有DMA，则CPU在执行I/O时被完全占用，因此多道程序没有任何好处(至少在CPU利用率方面)。不管一个程序做多少I/O，CPU都将100%繁忙。当然，假设主要的延迟时等待数据复制。如果I/O很慢，CPU可以做其他工作的原因(例如，到达串行线)
   
6. Instructions related to accessing I/O devices are typically privileged instructions, that is, they can be executed in kernel mode but not in user mode. Give a reason why these instructions are privileged. 
   1. 对I/O设备(例如，打印机)的访问通常受到不同用户的限制。有些用户可能被允许打印任意多的页面，有些用户可能根本不允许打印，而有些用户可能仅限于打印只有一定数量的页数。这些限制由系统管理员根据一些策略设置。需要强制执行这样的策略，以便用户级程序不能干扰它们。
   
7. The family-of-computers idea was introduced in the 1960s with the IBM System/360 mainframes. Is this idea now dead as a doornail or does it live on? 
   1. 它还活着。例如，英特尔生产的酷睿i3、i5和i7 cpu具有各种不同的属性，包括速度和功耗。所有这些机器在架构上是兼容的。它们只在价格和性能上有所不同，这是家庭理念的精髓。
   
8. One reason GUIs were initially slow to be adopted was the cost of the hardware needed to support them. How much video RAM is needed to support a 25-line × 80-row character monochrome text screen? How much for a 1200 × 900-pixel 24-bit color bit-map? What was the cost of this RAM at 1980 prices ($5/KB)? How much is it now? 
   1. 25×80 = 2000byte 1200×900×24／3=3240000byte 3240×5=16200
   
9. There are several design goals in building an operating system, for example, resource utilization, timeliness, robustness, and so on. Give an example of two design goals that may contradict one another. 
   1. 考虑公平性和实时性
   2. 公平要求以公平的方式分配每个进程的资源，没有进程获得超过其公平的资源份额。
   3. 实时性要求基于资源进行分配关于不同进程必须完成其执行的时间。实时进程可能会获得不成比例的资源份额。
   
10. What is the difference between kernel and user mode? Explain how having two distinct modes aids in designing an operating system. 

    1. kernel mode 执行指令集的每一个指令和硬件的每一个特点
    2. user mode 执行的指令和硬件的特点是kernel mode 的一个子集
    3. 拥有两个模式，可以允许设计者运行程序，因此也能拒绝访问核心指令

11. A 255-GB disk has 65,536 cylinders with 255 sectors per track and 512 bytes per sector. How many platters(盘片) and heads does this disk have? Assuming an average cylinder seek time of 11 ms, average rotational delay of 7 msec and reading rate of 100 MB/sec, calculate the average time it will take to read 400 KB from one sector.

    1. 磁道255*2^30
    2. heads=255GB/(65536\*255\*512)=32
    3. platters = 32/2 = 16
    4. 400KB/100MB=4ms 4+7+11 = 22ms

12. Which of the following instructions should be allowed only in kernel mode? 

    (a) Disable all interrupts. 

    (b) Read the time-of-day clock. 

    (c) Set the time-of-day clock. 

    (d) Change the memory map. 

    1. a,c,d

13. Consider a system that has two CPUs, each CPU having two threads (hyperthreading). Suppose three programs, P0, P1, and P2, are started with run times of 5, 10 and 20 msec, respectively. How long will it take to complete the execution of these programs? Assume that all three programs are 100% CPU bound, do not block during execution, and do not change CPUs once assigned. 

    1. 20ms 25ms 30ms 35ms都有可能

14. A computer has a pipeline with four stages. Each stage takes the same time to do its work, namely, 1 nsec. How many instructions per second can this machine execute? 

    1. 10^9

15. Consider a computer system that has cache memory, main memory (RAM) and disk, and an operating system that uses virtual memory. It takes 1 nsec to access a word from the cache, 10 nsec to access a word from the RAM, and 10 ms to access a word from the disk. If the cache hit rate is 95% and main memory hit rate (after a cache miss) is 99%, what is the average time to access a word? 

    0.95 × 1 nsec (word is in the cache) 

    0.05 × 0.99 × 10 nsec (word is in RAM, but not in the cache) 

    0.05 × 0.01 × 10,000,000 nsec (word on disk only) 

    = 5001.445 nsec 

    = 5.001445 μsec

16. When a user program makes a system call to read or write a disk file, it provides an indication of which file it wants, a pointer to the data buffer, and the count. Control is then transferred to the operating system, which calls the appropriate driver. Suppose that the driver starts the disk and terminates until an interrupt occurs. In the case of reading from the disk, obviously the caller will have to be blocked (because there are no data for it). What about the case of writing to the disk? Need the caller be blocked awaiting completion of the disk transfer? 

    1. 可能是。调用者拿回控制权并立即覆盖数据，当写操作最终发生时，会写入错误的数据。然而，如果驱动程序首先将数据复制到私有缓冲区，然后返回调用方法允许继续。
    2. 允许调用者继续并在缓冲区可能被重用时给一个信号，但是容易出错。

17. What is a trap instruction? Explain its use in operating systems. 

    1. 转换执行模式，从用户态转到核心态。允许用户程序，调用操作系统核心函数。

18. Why is the process table needed in a timesharing system? Is it also needed in personal computer systems running UNIX or Windows with a single user? 

    1. 进程表用于存储当前挂起(就绪或阻塞)的进程的状态。现代个人电脑系统即使用户什么都不做，也没有打开任何程序，仍有数十个进程在运行。他们正在检查更新、加载电子邮件和许多其他事情在UNIX系统上，可以使用ps -a命令查看它们。在Windows上
       系统中，使用任务管理器。

19. Is there any reason why you might want to mount a file system on a nonempty directory? If so, what is it? 

    1. 安装文件系统会使已经在挂载点目录不可访问，所以挂载点一般是空的。但系统管理员想要复制位于挂载目录的重要文件到挂载点。
    2. 以便在紧急情况下，当挂载的设备正在修复时，可以在其正常路径中找到它们。

20. For each of the following system calls, give a condition that causes it to fail: fork, exec, and unlink. 

21. What type of multiplexing (time, space, or both) can be used for sharing the following resources: CPU, memory, disk, network card, printer, keyboard, and display? 

22. Can the count = write(fd, buffer, nbytes); call return any value in count other than nbytes? If so, why? 

23. A file whose file descriptor is fd contains the following sequence of bytes: 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5. The following system calls are made: lseek(fd, 3, SEEK SET); read(fd, &buffer, 4);where the lseek call makes a seek to byte 3 of the file. What does buffer contain after the read has completed? 

24. Suppose that a 10-MB file is stored on a disk on the same track (track 50) in consecutive sectors. The disk arm is currently situated over track number 100. How long will it take to retrieve this file from the disk? Assume that it takes about 1 ms to move the arm from one cylinder to the next and about 5 ms for the sector where the beginning of the file is stored to rotate under the head. Also, assume that reading occurs at a rate of 200 MB/s. 

25. What is the essential difference between a block special file and a character special file? 

26. In the example given in Fig. 1-17, the library procedure is called read and the system call itself is called read. Is it essential that both of these have the same name? If not, which one is more important? 

27. Modern operating systems decouple a process address space from the machine’s physical memory. List two advantages of this design. 

28. To a programmer, a system call looks like any other call to a library procedure. Is it important that a programmer know which library procedures result in system calls? Under what circumstances and why? 

29. Figure 1-23 shows that a number of UNIX system calls have no Win32 API equivalents. For each of the calls listed as having no Win32 equivalent, what are the consequences for a programmer of converting a UNIX program to run under Windows? 

30. A portable operating system is one that can be ported from one system architecture to another without any modification. Explain why it is infeasible to build an operating system that is completely portable. Describe two high-level layers that you will have in designing an operating system that is highly portable. 

31. Explain how separation of policy and mechanism aids in building microkernel-based operating systems. 

32. Virtual machines have become very popular for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, they hav e some downsides. Name one. 

33. Here are some questions for practicing unit conversions: (a) How long is a nanoyear in seconds? (b) Micrometers are often called microns. How long is a megamicron? (c) How many bytes are there in a 1-PB memory? (d) The mass of the earth is 6000 yottagrams. What is that in kilograms? 

34. Write a shell that is similar to Fig. 1-19 but contains enough code that it actually works so you can test it. You might also add some features such as redirection of input and output, pipes, and background jobs. 

35. If you have a personal UNIX-like system (Linux, MINIX 3, FreeBSD, etc.) available that you can safely crash and reboot, write a shell script that attempts to create an unlimited number of child processes and observe what happens. Before running the experiment, type sync to the shell to flush the file system buffers to disk to avoid ruining the file system. You can also do the experiment safely in a virtual machine. Note: Do not try this on a shared system without first getting permission from the system administrator. The consequences will be instantly obvious so you are likely to be caught and sanctions may follow.

36. Examine and try to interpret the contents of a UNIX-like or Windows directory with a tool like the UNIX od program. (Hint: How you do this will depend upon what the OS allows. One trick that may work is to create a directory on a USB stick with one operating system and then read the raw device data using a different operating system that allows such access.)
